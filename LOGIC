opening file.

get_next_line_file, without the '\n' at the end.

if (buf[0]) meaning that is not a new line, 
we should the content inside of it.

if that line contains only the map_content charcter, 
then we break, meaning that we should now checkthe actual map,
and that all element before are stored.

if not then we still look for an element, 
to do so, we verify the start of the the line strimed from spaces,
with the charcters want to add + the next character should be a sapce,
if that line does not start with an element, then it is an error,
if the pointer that holds that element already exists, then it is an error.

In the process of extracting the contant we check if there's a tab, if so, it is an error.
